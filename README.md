# LSP Clients Generator

## Tool for creating LSP clients for different IDEs (Eclipse, Eclipse Che, VS Code, â€¦). 

The tool should be able to generate clients for the Apache Camel LSP server first. Although, it should be able to produce clients for an arbitrary LSP server.

The implemented tool should be easy to use and build on top of modern technologies and approaches.
